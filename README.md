# About me:
Hi everyone! 
My name is Fang Yi CHEN, I'm currently the exchange student here at HKBU.
I'm from Taiwan and study Radio and Television Broadcasting in my original university.
I've never have any experience about coding before, but I want to try it cause I think this should be a very useful skill :)



## Skills:
